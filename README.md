Introduction :

The Parabank Automation Project is designed to automate the functional testing of the Parabank web application using the Cypress testing framework.
The objective of this project is to ensure that all core functionalities of Parabank — such as user registration, login, account overview, and fund transfer — are working as expected after each deployment.
Cypress has been chosen because it provides a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly end-to-end testing environment for web applications.

Project Overview :

This automation project focuses on validating both UI and functional flows of Parabank. The framework is structured using Cypress’s best practices and includes modular components such as fixtures, custom commands, and dynamic test data generation using Faker.js.
Each test case has been written to simulate real-world user interactions and verify expected outcomes. The framework is scalable and maintainable, allowing easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and reporting tools.

Tools and Technologies Used :

Cypress: The main automation framework used for writing and executing end-to-end tests.
Faker.js: Used to generate dynamic test data like random names, emails, addresses, and usernames.
Fixtures: Used for managing static data in JSON format for reusable test inputs.
Custom Commands: Created to encapsulate repetitive actions such as login, registration, or navigation, making the tests more readable and maintainable.
Mocha and Chai: These are Cypress’s built-in test runner and assertion libraries that help in structuring and validating the test cases.

Framework Structure :

The framework is organized to maintain clarity and separation of concerns. It follows a standard Cypress directory structure with dedicated folders for tests, fixtures, and reusable commands.
e2e Folder: Contains all end-to-end test scripts such as login, registration, and fund transfer.
Fixtures Folder: Contains static test data in JSON format that can be used across multiple test cases.
Support Folder: Includes custom commands and global configuration files.
Utilities (optional): Includes helper functions, such as data generation using Faker.

Conclusion :

The Parabank Automation Project demonstrates a complete and well-structured Cypress-based automation framework.
It ensures functional accuracy, data integrity, and overall application stability through systematic automated testing.
By combining Cypress’s powerful capabilities with custom commands, fixtures, and Faker-generated data, the framework achieves both flexibility and efficiency in regression and functional testing.
