This project is an automation test suite built with Cypress for the Parabank demo banking application. The goal is to validate key banking workflows such as login, registration, fund transfers, and account overview.
The suite is designed to improve testing efficiency, reduce manual effort, and provide reliable regression coverage for critical features.
What’s Covered:
- Login – Valid and invalid login scenarios
- Registration – Creating new users with dynamic test data
- Fund Transfer – Moving funds between accounts and verifying balances
- Bill pay and tracking the transaction ID
- Account Overview – Validating account details and transactions
- UI Checks – Ensuring page elements load and display correctly
-  Pipeline Workflow with cypress configuration  - on every code push the workflow runs itself , which helps in Regression
